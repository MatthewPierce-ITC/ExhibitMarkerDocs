### ID Editing

ExhibitMarker brands and stampes each exhibit according to the value present in the ExhibitID field.

When exhibits are loaded via drag-and-drop or folder import, the ExhbitID field is updated with the same value as the Filename, minus the ".pdf" extension.  Often the exhibit files are named only with their respective IDs, but occasionally there is extra information about the exhibit's contents.

There are two ways to remove this extra information from the ExhibitID field so that the Stamp and Brand only reflect the needed ID.

### Manual Edit

Right-click a selected exhbit in the PDF List to bring up the right-click menu.

> ![Screen Grab - Right-Click menu of PDF List](id_editing_assets/idEdit_01_rightClickMenu.png)

Select Edit ID.  This will display a window that allows you to modify the ID for the currently selected exhibit.  When you have modified the ID to suit your needs, click Change ID and the document ID edit is complete.
