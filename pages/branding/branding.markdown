### Branding Exhibits

An exhibit Brand is a custom header or footer that you add to each page of the document.  We call this a Brand because once it is added to the document it cannot be changed or removed.

ExhibitMarker&trade; enables the user to apply Brands to individual documents, a selection of documents, or the entire document population.  This process is extremely fast compared to most available tools.  With this in mind, it is important to remember that you cannot undo a brand.  It is highly suggested that you use a different [Destination Folder](../working_with_files/working_with_files_destination_folder.markdown) for branded documents, so that you can easily [Revert to Original](../working_with_files/working_with_files_unmarking.markdown) if you identify a typo or a change that needs to be made.
