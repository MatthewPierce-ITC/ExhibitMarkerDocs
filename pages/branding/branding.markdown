### Branding Exhibits

An exhibit Brand is a custom header or footer that is added to each page of the document.  It is referred to as a Brand because once it is added to the document it cannot be changed or removed.

ExhibitMarker&trade; enables the user to apply Brands to individual documents, a selection of documents, or the entire document population.  This process is very fast compared to most available tools.  With this in mind, it is importatant to remember that you cannot undo a brand.  It is highly suggested that you use a different Destination Folder for your branded documents, so that you can easily [Revert to Original](../working_with_files/working_with_files_unmarking.markdown) if a typo is identified or a change needs to be made.
