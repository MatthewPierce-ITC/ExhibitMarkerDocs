### Brand Application

### Preview

Before applying the brand to some or all of the exhibits, it is suggested that the user preview the brand on several of the documents.  This allows the user to zoom in and out, and fine tune the brand to make sure that the end product will appear as intended.

Select any exhibit from the PDF File list and then click Generate Preview from the Brand tab.

The selected PDF will then be re-rendered with the current brand design.  If additional changes are made to the brand design, simply click the Generate Preview button again and the selected PDF will reload and reflect the current draft brand.  The brand does not have to be saved at this point for the changes to be displayed.

Once the brand design is finalized and saved it may be applied to a selection or the entire population of documents.  For a subset of the population, select the desired PDFs in the PDF File list using right-click, shift-right-click, or ctrl-right-click.  Once the documents are highlighted, click Apply to Selected PDFs.  If Apply to All PDFs is the desired operation, no highlighting is required.

A progress bar will display along with the current Exhibit ID and page number being branded.  The process may be canceled, but will progress rather quickly.  As each document is completed, a checkmark will appear in the Brand column of the PDF File list.
