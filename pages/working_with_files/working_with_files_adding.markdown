PDF files for marking may be loaded into ExhibitMarker&trade; either by drag-and-drop, or folder selection via Import from the menu toolbar. 

### Drag-and-Drop

The drag-and-drop method is generally the easiest way to load files into ExhibitMarker&trade; for processing.  As seen below, select the PDF files to add and drag them into the "PDF Files" section of the user interface.  The application will then process each file individually, calculating pages as it loads.

You may cancel the operation at any time during the loading process.  Once the process is complete, you may select files for viewing.
