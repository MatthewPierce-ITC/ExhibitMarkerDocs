### Removing Files

If there are PDFs in the collection that need to be removed, this can be done via the right-click menu of the PDF File list.  The first option is Clear All, which will remove all the PDFs in the current project.

> ![Screen Grab - Clear All right-click menu TEST](working_with_files_assets/working_with_files_removing_01_clearall.png)

When this item is selected a pop-up warning will appear alerting the user that this operation cannot be undone.  Once files are removed from the project they must be manually reloaded.  This will also remove their current Stamped or Branded status in the PDF File list.

A second option is to clear an individual or selection of files, rather than the entire popuplation.  For this procedure, select an individual or group of files, then right-click to bring up the menu.

> ![Screen Grab - Clear Selected](working_with_files_assets/working_with_files_removing_03_clearselected.png)

The same warning will appear as with the Clear All option.
