When a PDF files is processed via Stamping or Branding, the entry in the PDF Files window is updated to show a checkmark in the respective Stamp and/or Brand column, and the entire entry is highlighted.

There are times when you may need to re-stamp or re-brand a PDF files.  To start the process, select the file or files in the PDF Files list, then hover over the selection and right-click on the selected items.  This will bring up "Revert to Original" in the right-click menu.

You will then be prompted to confirm the operation, and ExhibitMarker&trade; will then update the database to point at the Original PDF files that were loaded into the project.

If the original files are no longer at that location, the entries will be updated with an exclamation point and yellow highlighting.  Please see [Locating Lost Files](working_with_files_locatinglost.markdown) to resolve this issue.
