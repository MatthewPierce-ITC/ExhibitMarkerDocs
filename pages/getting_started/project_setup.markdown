### Project Setup

When ExhibitMarker&trade; is opened you are prompted to open an existing project or create a new one:

> ![Screen grab of User Interface starting view](/pages/getting_started/user_interface/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_01_Start.png "Initial View")

Selecting "Create New Project" displays the Project naming window, as seen below:

> ![Screen grab of User Interface Project Name window](/pages/getting_started/user_interface/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_02_CreateNewProject.png "Project Naming Window")

Once a name, and optional matter number, is entered you are then asked to select a save location for the project database (given the .db3 extension).  Note the location of this file, as it will be necessary to navigate the application to this directory when you open ExhibitMarker&trade; in the future to access these files.
