### Project Setup

When ExhibitMarker&trade; is opened you are prompted to open an existing project or create a new one:

> ![Screen grab of User Interface starting view](user_interface/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_01_Start.png)

Selecting "Create New Project" displays the Project naming window, as seen below:

> ![Screen grab of User Interface Project Name window](user_interface/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_02_CreateNewProject.png)

Once a name, and optional matter number, is entered you are then asked to select a save location for the project database.  Note the location of this file, as it will be necessary to navigate the application to this directory when you open ExhibitMarker&trade; in the future to access these files.
